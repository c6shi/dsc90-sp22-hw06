In 1854, John Snow created his infamous cholera outbreak map, where he tallied the number of deaths from cholera at each address in Soho, London. He also plotted the water pumps, predicting that since most cholera related deaths surrounded the Broad Street pump, cholera was a waterborne disease, rather than due to "bad air". This is a successful (and well cited) example of how choosing the right data visualization can change one's perspective and helped propel Dr. Snow to go against conventional idea about how diseases spread.
