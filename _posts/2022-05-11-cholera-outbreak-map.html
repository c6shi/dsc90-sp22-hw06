<p>In 1854, John Snow created his infamous cholera outbreak map, where he tallied the number of deaths from cholera at each address in Soho, London.
    He also plotted the locations of water pumps, which led him to predict that since most cholera related deaths surrounded the Broad Street pump,
    cholera was a waterborne disease, rather than due to the conventional idea of "bad air".</p>

<p>Dr. Snow's cholera map is a classic example of how choosing the right data visualization can change someone's perspective,
    and it helped propel Dr. Snow to go against conventional idea about how diseases spread.</p>

Here is the original map drawn by Dr. Snow:

<p>Some notes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each black tally represents a death by cholera at that address.</li>
    <li>Each circle labeled "PUMP" represents a water pump.</li>
    <li>In the center of the map, we see a high density of cholera cases. The Broad Street Pump also happens to be
        right at the intersection of Broad Street and Cambridge Street.</li>
    <li>Additionally, many of the other pumps do not have any or have very few incidents of cholera-related deaths.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Attempt 1: folium</h5>

    Here's my very simple version with the folium package:

<p>Some notes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each brown circle represents an address where cholera deaths occurred.</li>
    <li>The size of the circle indicates the frequency of cholera-related deaths at an address.
        Clearly, the circle near the Broad Street Pump is much larger than other circles.</li>
    <li>Each blue marker represents a water pump.</li>
