description: a jekyll site for replicas of historical data visualizations
background: '/images/scripps-pier.jpg'
---
This is my first Jekyll site in conjunction with GitHub pages to display my attempts at recreating historical data visualizations with a few tweaks to reflect the present level of technology and available datasets. These "historical" data visualizations include John Snow's cholera outbreak map and Charles Dupin's choropleth map of literacy levels in French departments.

What I have learned through this process:
<br>
* vim editor
<br>
* how to build a jekyll site and connect it to github
<br>
* plotly express
<br>
* I enjoy this kind of work :D
